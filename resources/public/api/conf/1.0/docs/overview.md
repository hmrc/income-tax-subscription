This API allows users to subscribe to the Making Tax Digital for Business - Income Tax service.

This will allow users to maintain digital accounts using third party applications and opt-in
to submitting regular updates to HMRC via the application.

Once subscribed to the service the user will be able to use other APIs to tell HMRC about their
sources of income and submit updates to HMRC regularly.
